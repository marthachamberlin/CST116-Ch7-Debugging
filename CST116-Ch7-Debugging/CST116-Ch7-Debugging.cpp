/********************************************************************
* File: CST116-Ch7-Debugging.cpp
*
* General Instructions: Complete each step before proceeding to the
* next.
*
* Debugging Exercise 1
*
* 1) Insert a breakpoint on the lines indicated in the code.
* 2) Run to Breakpoint 1.
* 3) When prompted, enter your age.
* 4) When the execution stops, add a watch on age and verify that
*    the value in age is what you typed in.
* 5) Step over the if statement.
* 6) Why did the value in age change?
* 7) Fix the problem and repeat Steps 2 – 5 to verify the
*    problem was corrected.
* 8) Stop debugging.
*
* Debugging Exercise 2
*
* 1) Run to Breakpoint 1.
* 2) When prompted, enter the value 25 for your age.
* 3) Step over the if statement. Execution of the program should
*    continue on the else if statement.
* 4) Verify that 25 is still stored in age.
* 5) Step over the else if.
* 6) Why is the program going to print "Teenager" for an age of 25?
* 7) Fix the problem and repeat Steps 1 – 5 to verify the
*    problem was corrected.
* 8) Stop debugging.
* 9) Remove Breakpoint1.
*
* Debugging Exercise 3
*
* 1) Run the program without debugging.
* 2) When prompted, enter the value of 10 for your age.
* 3) Why does the program print both "Child" and "Adult"?
* 4) Re-run the program this time with debugging and run to
*    Breakpoint 2.
* 5) Why is the action with the else executing?
* 6) Fix the problem and re-run to verify the problem was corrected.
